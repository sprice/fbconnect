-- SUMMARY --

This module roughly acts like the OpenId Drupal 6.x core module :
- It lets you use your Facebook ID and password to sign-in to your drupal site.
- Users can see which of their Facebook friends had an account on your drupal site.
- Users can publish a feed on their Facebook feed announcing that they have created an account or commented an article on your website.
- Users can invite their Facebook friends to create an account on the Drupal website.
- In case the user already holds an account on the website: The user can choose to link his drupal account to his Facebook identity.

-- FACEBOOK CONNECT TAB --

This module adds a new Facebook Connect tab in the user's profile page. This tab allows to change: 
- the "Use my Facebook picture as user picture" setting.
This field can be seen only if user_pictures is enabled.
The profile picture will be displayed directly from Facebook via FBML.  

- the "Let my Facebook friends see me" setting
If this parameter is enabled, the user's will be visible by her Facebook friends.
